Given an array of integers, transform each element by replacing it with its rank based on its value.

Ranking is determined by the following rules:

    Ranks start at 1.
    Higher values are assigned higher ranks.
    If multiple elements are equal, they receive the same rank.
    Ranks must be assigned with the smallest possible values.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [50, 15, 25, 35]
Output: [4, 1, 2, 3]
Explanation: 50 has the highest value, while 15 is the lowest. 25 ranks second, and 35 ranks third.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [200, 200, 200]
Output: [1, 1, 1]
Explanation: All elements are equal, so they share the same rank.

Example 3:
Input: arr = [45, 17, 29, 13, 120, 60, 85, 8, 17]
Output: [6, 3, 4, 2, 9, 7, 8, 1, 3]
Explanation: Each value is ranked, with 120 being the largest and 8 the smallest. Equal values (17) share the same rank.

Constraints:
The array contains between 0 and 10^5 elements.
Each elementâ€™s value lies between -10^9 and 10^9.
