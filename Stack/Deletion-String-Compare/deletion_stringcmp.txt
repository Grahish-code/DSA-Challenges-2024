You are provided with two strings s and t. Your task is to determine if they are identical when typed into empty text editors, where the character '#' acts as a backspace operation.

Note: If backspacing occurs when there is no character to delete, the text remains empty.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "xy#z", t = "xz#z"
Output:
true

Explanation:
Both strings transform into "xz".

Example 2:

Input:
s = "a##", t = "b##"
Output:
true

Explanation:
After applying backspaces, both strings result in an empty string.

Example 3:

Input:
s = "a#b", t = "x"
Output:
false

Explanation:
After processing, s becomes "b" while t remains "x", hence they are not the same.

Constraints:
The length of both strings s and t will be at least 1 and at most 200.
Strings s and t will consist of lowercase alphabetic characters and the '#' symbol.
