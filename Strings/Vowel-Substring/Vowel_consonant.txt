You are provided with a string word and a non-negative integer k. Your objective is to determine how many substrings of word exist that contain all five vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') at least once and exactly k consonants.

Example 1:

Input:
word = "aeiozz", k = 2
Output:
0

Explanation:
No substring contains every vowel.

Example 2:

Input:
word = "aeiou", k = 0
Output:
1

Explanation:
The substring "aeiou" contains every vowel and no consonants.

Example 3:

Input:
word = "uoieaxxuoieaaxx", k = 2
Output:
3

Explanation:
The substrings that contain all the vowels and exactly 2 consonants are:

"uoieax"
"xuoiea"
"uoieaa"

Constraints:
The length of word will be between 5 and 250 characters.
The string will consist solely of lowercase English letters.
k will be a non-negative integer between 0 and the length of word minus 5.
