Given a text string and a pattern string, find all occurrences of the pattern within the text and return their starting indices.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input 1: Text: "geeksforgeeks", Pattern: "geek"
Output 1: 1, 9

Input 2: Text: "abesdu", Pattern: "edu"
Output 2: -1

Explanation: The function should return a list of indices where the pattern string starts in the text string. If no occurrences are found, the function should return -1.

Constraints:
The length of the text string is between 1 and 10^6 characters.
The length of the pattern string is between 1 and the length of the text string, excluding the length of the text string itself.
Both strings contain only lowercase English letters.

Input: 
The function should take two strings as input:

Text string: This is the string where you want to search for occurrences of the pattern.
Pattern string: This is the string you are searching for within the text string.
