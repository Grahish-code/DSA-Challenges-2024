Given a queue, reverse the order of its elements.

Example Inputs and Outputs:

Input 1: A queue with elements 4, 3, 1, 10, 2, and 6.
Output 1: A reversed queue with elements 6, 2, 10, 1, 3, and 4.

Input 2: A queue with elements 4, 3, 2, and 1.
Output 2: A reversed queue with elements 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Explanation:
The function should reverse the order of the elements in the queue.

Constraints:
The queue can have between 1 and 10^5 elements.
The elements in the queue are between 1 and 10^5.

Input:
The function should take a single queue as input. The queue is represented by a data structure that supports the following operations:

Enqueue: Adds an element to the back of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
