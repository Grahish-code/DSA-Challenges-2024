Given the head of a singly linked list, find and return the middle node.

If the list contains an even number of nodes, return the second of the two middle nodes.

Example 1:
Input: head = [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
Output: [9, 10, 11]
Explanation: The middle node is the one with value 9.

Example 2:
Input: head = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Output: [6, 7, 8]
Explanation: The list has two middle nodes with values 5 and 6, so the second one (node 6) is returned.

Constraints:
The linked list contains between 1 and 100 nodes.
Each node's value will be between 1 and 100.
