Given the root of a binary tree, determine the tree's greatest depth.

The maximum depth of a binary tree is the count of nodes along the longest route from the root to the deepest leaf.

Example 1:
Input: root = [5, 12, 25, null, null, 8, 10]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: root = [2, null, 9]
Output: 2

Constraints:
The total number of nodes in the tree will be between 0 and 10^4.
Each node's value will range from -100 to 100.
